# MovieApp

## ```MovieApp``` is a movie searching app (done in 1.5 days as a test task, which is not that bad, if you think about it)
It gives you the list of movies from [this site](https://www.themoviedb.org/)  
You can click on the movie and route to a separate screen with its core data,
or you can search a movie you like.  
Also it stores the data you already loaded, liked movies line, movie detail screen or search result, so later you can surf through what you already looked for offline
